            Until recently I had a lot of passions and coding was not one of them. 
            It is one of those things that grow on you. I am a huge soccer fan and my favorite
            teams are FC Barcelona and Manchester City FC. One of the things that drew me to coding
            was the language aspect. I enjoy learning languages spoken or otherwise.
